    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you'll get to practice some of the concepts and skills covered in the following notebooks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Binary Search and Complexity Analysis](https://jovian.ai/aakashns/python-binary-search)\n",
    "3. [Solving Programming Problems Systematically](https://jovian.ai/aakashns/python-problem-solving-template)\n",

    "As you go through this notebook, you will find a **???** in certain places. To complete this assignment, you must replace all the **???** with appropriate values, expressions or statements to ensure that the notebook runs properly end-to-end. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some things to keep in mind:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Make sure to run all the code cells, otherwise you may get errors like `NameError` for undefined variables.\n",
    "* Do not change variable names, delete cells or disturb other existing code. It may cause problems during evaluation.\n",

    "The recommended way to run this notebook is to click the \"Run\" button at the top of this page, and select \"Run on Binder\". This will run the notebook on [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org), a free online service for running Jupyter notebooks. \n",
    "\n",

    "#### Option 1: Running using free online resources (1-click, recommended)\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to start executing the code is to click the **Run** button at the top of this page and select **Run on Binder**. You can also select \"Run on Colab\" or \"Run on Kaggle\", but you'll need to create an account on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) or [Kaggle](https://kaggle.com) to use these platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Option 2: Running on your computer locally\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the code on your computer locally, you'll need to set up [Python](https://www.python.org), download the notebook and install the required libraries. We recommend using the [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/) distribution of Python. Click the **Run** button at the top of this page, select the **Run Locally** option, and follow the instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Saving your work\n",
    "\n",
    "Before staring the assignment, let's save a snapshot of the assignment to your [Jovian](https://jovian.ai) profile, so that you can access it later, and continue your work."

Write a function to determine the minimum number of times the original sorted list was rotated to obtain the given list.

    "Our first goal should always be to come up with a _correct_ solution to the problem, which may not necessarily be the most _efficient_ solution. Try to think of a solution before you read further. \n",
    "\n",
    "Coming up with the correct solution is quite easy, and it's based on this insight: If a list of sorted numbers is rotated `k` times, then the smallest number in the list ends up at position `k` (counting from 0). Further, it is the only number in the list which is smaller than the number before it. Thus, we simply need to **check for each number in the list whether it is smaller than the number that comes before it** (if there is a number before it). Then, our answer i.e. the number of rotations is simply the position of this number is . If we cannot find such a number, then the list wasn't rotated at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: In the list `[19, 25, 29, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 14]`, the number `3` is the only number smaller than its predecessor. It occurs at the position `3` (counting from `0`), hence the array was rotated `3` times.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the *linear search* algorithm as a first attempt to solve this problem i.e. we can perform the check for every position one by one. But first, try describing the above solution in your own words, that make it clear to you.\n",
